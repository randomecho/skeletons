Notes

- Do not cite Wikipedia, Huffington Post, Daily Mail, tabloids, Fox News, blogs
  and related sites of dubious quality/nature as sources. 
- If source is from a book, find a link to preview pages, such as Google Books, 
  and mention the author, title and publisher.
- If source is video, link to video and provide timestamps of when to start watching
  up to when the reference ends. Even if that means the whole video.
